I am a Molecular Biologist, experienced in genome data analysis. I founded [Palindrome](https://palinlab.com/) in Iran, developed two algortihms for exome data analysis, which resolved tens of challenging undiagnosed cases and helped hundreds of families suffring from rare disorders: \
**PalinDepth**: a CNV detection tool from short read exome data, \
**PalinVar**: a point-based scoring system for ACMG-based classification of SNVs and INDELs. \
I also developed a tool for haplotype analysis of ROH regions from exome data. This is useful for a rare pathogenic variant that is common among distant families, aiming to investigate if such variants are founder or recurrent. \
Recently I screened hundreds of exomes for STR expansions in neuromuscular patients with different ethnicities. Creating a reference panel of STR loci is my ongoing project. I am also working on GWAS on dementia and neurodegenerative diseases.
