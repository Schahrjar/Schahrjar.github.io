A Molecular Biologist, experienced in genome data analysis. Founding [Palindrome](https://palinlab.com/) in Iran, I have developed two algortihms for exome data analysis, which resolved tens of undiagnosed cases:
* **PalinDepth**: a CNV detection tool
* **PalinVar**: a point based scoring system for ACMG-based classification of short variants


Detecting common pathogenic variants by analysing thousands of exomes from distant families, I created a tool for haplotype analysis of ROH regions from exome data. This uncovers if such variants are founder, i.e. inherited from the same ancestor, or recurrent.

Recently I screened hundreds of exomes for STR expansions in neuromuscular patients from different ethnic groups. Creating a reference panel of STR loci is my ongoing project.
